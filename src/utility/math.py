# class that produces mathematical functions
# these functions can only operate on JunkBox objects
# and return JunkBox objects
# The functions must be returned so that the driver can pass them to the executors
# The driver will then wait for the results and return them to the user.
#
# The driver will expose an api to the user that will allow
# the user to perform matix math operations
# The user will create matrices and then perform operations on them.
# The driver will then create jobs
# and send them to the executors.
# The driver will then wait for the results and return them to the user.
# this class should act like a factory for mathematical functions
# the functions should be returned so that the driver can pass them to the executors
